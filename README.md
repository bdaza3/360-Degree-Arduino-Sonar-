# 360-Degree-Arduino-Sonar-System

This system consists of a 360-degree sonar utilizing three Arduino’s equipped with Bluetooth communication to provide an encompassing spatial awareness device. The system features a user interface consisting of an LCD screen and a keypad, allowing users to easily input commands and receive feedback on detected distances from the sonar system. LED indicators provide visual feedback on the vicinity of detected objects, enhancing user interaction. This project demonstrates the capabilities of utilizing Arduino’s to detect objects and report their locations in relation to them.
